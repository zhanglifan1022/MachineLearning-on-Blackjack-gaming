Hey Guys.
Welcome to the project. This is a machine learning program based on blackjack gaming.

No possibilities is calculated in the program. None prohibitation is set in the game.

All decision made by computer will be randomly but with an increasing tendency if thats the  'good' choice determined by experience database.

The computer can be really sily at early stage but the more games he played the smarter he will be. So lets see how far he could become!

Heres the blue print:

1.create a basic blackjack system.(rule:can double,hit,stand and surrender/cant split now) *********finished**********

2.boxing the data to keep them safe.*********finished**********

3.output the data of each game to a txt file, as know as our experience data base.*********finished**********

4.real-time changing the tendency of all 4 options of each pattern on data base.*********finished**********

5.sort out the data for easier querying.*********finished**********

6.input the tendency to main program.*********finished**********

7.let the computer select its own option base on experience database.*********finished**********

7.1 Computer vs Human gaming added, you can have system as dealer against computer(automatically) and you as player on one table. lets see who got better win rate after 20 games!!

8.Total:100000000/10000000000000 games played.*********Ongoing**********

8.1 Current win rate(steady state after 1h running):

2017/11/6 ~42%

2017/11/4 Â ~41%

2017/11/3   ~39% 

2017/11/2   ~32%

2017/11/1   ~30%

9. Learning BP neural network so as to modify punishment/rewarding value.

10.proved that the computer win rate can infinitely approach the theoretical and mathematical win rate, cause he is 
always tend to take the 'right' option.
