3.output the data of each game to a txt file, as know as our experience data base.*********finished**********

4.real-time changing the tendency of all 4 options of each pattern on data base.

5.sort out the data for easier querying.

6.input the tendency to main program.

7.let the computer select its own option base on experience database.

8.total:0/100000 games played.
